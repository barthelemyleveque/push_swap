# push_swap

The idea is simple, you have two stacks called Stack A and Stack B. 

Stack A is given a random list of unorganized numbers. You must take the random list of numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest. 
There’s only a few moves you’re allowed to used to manipulate the stacks that we’re going to called “Actions”. 
The main goal of this project is to organize Stack A in as few actions as possible.
